A pluggable web based CMS for Firebase.

## Configuration

### Your first user
Before logging in with your first user, you want to make sure that it's only you who get access to your site.

Configure yourself as the owner of the site by running this command in your project root

```bash
firebase functions:config:set tanam.owner=john.doe@example.com
```

Exchange the email `john.doe@example.com` with the email that you will login as the "site owner". Don't worry,
you can add more admin users later. This is just to enable you to login directly after deploying the site.

### Cache
The default values for client/browser cache and server/CDN cache are set in (`routing.ts`)[/src/utils/routing.ts].

Configure alternative caching values with cloud functions config.

```bash
firebase functions:config:set cache.serverAge=12345
firebase functions:config:set cache.clientAge=123
```
